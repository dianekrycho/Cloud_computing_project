## Quick information

This backend connects to a MongoDB Database containing locations of film sets in Paris, France.

Consulting locations requires an account. Creating, updating and deleting locations requires elevated privileges.

There are 2 access level: `user` and `admin`. Each user have a `role` property to store this data.

Users can authenticate themselves with a Json Web Token, obtained by logging-in with their `username` and `password`.

Passwords are hashed, and the hashes are never shown in API responses.
